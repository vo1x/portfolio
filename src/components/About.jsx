          Hello! I'm volx and I enjoy developing things. My interest in web development started back
          in 2021 when I first tried making a website for my school project â€” surprisingly getting a
          navbar to stick to the top is a great way to learn HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, I've expanded into JavaScript for interactivity and backend technologies like
          Python and Django. I'm passionate about developing seamless user interfaces without
          compromising the user experience.I enjoy experimenting with new ideas for personal
          projects, and contributing to Open Source Projects.
